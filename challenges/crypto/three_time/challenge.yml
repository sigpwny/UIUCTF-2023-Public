  "We've been monitoring our adversaries' communication channels, but they encrypt their data with XOR one-time pads! However, we hear rumors that they're reusing the pads...\n\nEnclosed are three encrypted messages. Our mole overheard the plaintext of message 2. Given this information, can you break the enemy's encryption and get the plaintext of the other messages?"
