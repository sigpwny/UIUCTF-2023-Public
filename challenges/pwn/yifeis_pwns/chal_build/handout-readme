This directory contains:

- chal_build: The files used to build the challenges.
- run: Pre-built files in case you want to run the challenges locally. This is
  the same copy of the challenge files running on the server.

These challenges might be very difficult to debug, so I'm providing a root
shell. To play around with an unprivileged user, you can use the same setpriv
command as the remote host.

I also bundled gcc per popular request from last year. Apologies for the
size of the handle bundle. Since most of the overhead (gdb and gcc) are shared
between these challenes, I'm making it into a single bundle.
