  This challenge is inspired by TSJ CTF 2022's
  ["virus" challenge](https://github.com/XxTSJxX/TSJ-CTF-2022/tree/main/Pwn/Virus).

  I thought a virus could be even tinier, but I there's a catch: are viruses
  alive or dead? What separates living organisms from lifeless objects? Can
  viruses [infect other viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virophage)?

  **Note: This challenge has not been solved by the author.**
  [Have fun!](https://xkcd.com/356/)

  `$ socat file:$(tty),raw,echo=0 tcp:virophage.chal.uiuc.tf:1337`

  Handout: Same as `Zapping a Setuid 1`
