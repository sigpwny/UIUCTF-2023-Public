  We found my brother's old iMac but forgot the password, maybe you can help me get in?

  He said he was working on something involving "pointer authentication codes" and "a custom kernel"?
  I can't recall...

  Attached is the original Snow Leopard kernel macho as well as the kernel running on the iMac.

  ### Notes

  Note that we have backported patches for several known Snow Leopard N-Days!
  It is our belief that the easiest way to solve this challenge is the intended solution.

  If you want to create an image for local testing, follow the instructions here:
  1. https://github.com/jprx/how-to-install-snow-leopard-in-qemu
  1. Make sure you disable journaling so that you can edit the filesystem from your host if something breaks!
  1. Inside the VM, rename `/System/Library/Extensions/AppleProfileFamily.kext` to `AppleProfileFamily.kext.bak`.
  1. Delete `/mach_kernel` and replace it with the attached `mach_kernel.sigpwny` file (saved as `/mach_kernel`).
  1. Reboot the VM and then run `uname -v`, you should see the version string of `sigpwny:xnu-1456.1.2.6/BUILD/obj//RELEASE_X86_64`.
  1. Install Xcode 3.2 (`xcode3210a432.dmg`) inside the VM to get `gcc`.

  ### Connecting to Our Instance

  Password for the user `user` is `user`. Flag is ravi's password. The flag is also at `/flag`. You can also
  ssh into the remote machine by (`inst-1234567890123456` is the ID of your instance):

  `ssh user@inst-1234567890123456 -J user@mock-bastion.chal.uiuc.tf:1337 -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no`
